 Currently studying at **[Coder Academy](https://coderacademy.edu.au/)** in Brisbane, Australia. In the first few days of orientation, **[Jhey's Twitter Handle](https://twitter.com/jh3yy)** gets recommended alongside **[Louise Flanagan's](https://twitter.com/flangerhanger)** *(a further progressed fellow Coder student)* as well for their awesome CSS art. The content they create has been constant motivation for not only myself, but many others in the cohort who are in the process of changing their careers into tech.
